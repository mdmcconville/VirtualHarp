Harp GUI

I created the initial version and all subsequent iterations sporadically from Fall 2012 to Fall 2013. I love the harp and wanted to create something that reflected that.

This was coded in C++ and I collected all of the sound files myself using my own harp. I apologize for any out-of-tune notes. I've used this successfully in Windows 7.
